    * Question: Write a function to detect if a year is leap year or not     
    Description: Determine if a given year is a leap year. 
    Rule: Year divisible by 4 → leap year, except centuries not divisible by 400. 
    Example: 
    Input: 
    2000 
    Output: 
    Leap year 
    Input: 
    1900 
    Output: 
    Not leap year
